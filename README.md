# Tams-Pizzeria-.NET-Core-Web-App
This is an extension of the former WPF Tams-Pizzeria Employee Portal. Based on the fictional pizza restaurant, Tams' Pizzeria. Upon learning about .NET Core and Microsoft Azure, I decided to embark on the challenge of learning this newer .NET technology. This is not only a .NET Core MVC Web App, it is an extension of what could have been. This web app allows customers to register/log-in and create online orders and view their history. This web app also provides an employee portal for the employees to be able to do their job, view, and manipulate the information in the database (Microsoft SQL Server).

This web application uses the .NET Core 2.0 Framework. Utilizing the middleware pipeline - authentication, authorization, dependency injection, Entity Framework Core, etc.

This web application is currently running live. A demo is available at <a href="https://tamspizzeria.azurewebsites.net/">Tams' Pizzeria</a>.

*This is a continuous work in progress (started late March 2019). As such, the live demo may or may not be up to date with current progress. 
The same is applicable to the images below.* 

Thanks,
